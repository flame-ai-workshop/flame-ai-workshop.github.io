# Mission
To foster a dynamic forum for exchanging ideas, data, methods, and models related to ML techniques for combustion, turbulence, and fluid dynamics - fields crucial to the development of energy, propulsion, climate, and safety systems. 

# Agenda
1. Lectures and talks will be given by AI/ML experts within Stanford and industry partners from the Greater Silicon Valley area.
2. Practical exercises<sup>*</sup> and tutorial sessions will be held to tackle generative modeling challenges in combustion, turbulence, and fluid dynamics.
<sup>*</sup>The outcomes of these practical exercises will be compiled towards a collaborative publication.
